# Measuring cable loss
To test an antenna, the cable loss can be measured for each antenna from within the radar hut. To do this, the mobile antenna analyzer can be used. These values should be recorded and entered into the month-end reports.

The antenna analyzer is usually kept in the radar hut for convenience. Measurements should be made at least every second month to ensure that all antennas are still in good condition. To make a cable loss measurement:
1. Plug in the analyzer's power supply.
1. Disconnect the antenna cable from the transceiver box.
1. Connect the antenna cable to the port on the analyzer.
1. Read and record the value shown for the range between 12.5 MHz and 14.5 MHz.
1. Reconnect the antenna cable to the transceiver box.

There are several other measurements that can also be made with the analyzer, but none of which will provide any useful information for regular maintenance checks. However, they might be useful for fault finding with the antenna baluns or load connections.
