## Radar Hut
This section provides instructions for the maintenance of the radar hut and inventory lists of its contents.

The radar hut consists of two compartments: The lobby and the radar room, separated by a door. The lobby contains most of the supplies, while the radar room contains the radar hardware and a cabinet of some smaller spare components, stationary and miscellaneous items.

### Emergency Supplies
The radar hut is located about 600m from the base. This means that one can get stuck there if the weather changes abruptly and becomes unfavorable for traveling back to the base. Thus, the hut is stocked with emergency supplies for this eventuality. Supplies for medical emergencies are also necessary since the base is so far away.

It is the responsibility of the overwintering radar engineer to see that these supplies are always up to standard and not expired. See \tabref{infra_supplies} below for a comprehensive list of all supplies that need to be in the radar hut at all times:
