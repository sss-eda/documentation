## Infrastructure Overview
The infrastructure of the radar and the maintenance thereof are discussed in depth [here](2_infrastructure.md). The radar's infrastructure consist of 20 antenna masts and a hut which houses all of the radar's transceiver and server equipment, as well as the network and electricity connection to the base infrastructure.

The radar hut is located about 600m South-East of the base at the center of the main antenna array, as shown in [figure 1](#figure-1-map-of-sanae-iv-science-area). There is a lifeline stretching from the base to the radar hut, as indicated on the map in [figure 1](#figure-1-map-of-sanae-iv-science-area).

Electricity is relayed from the base to the radar hut, from where it is also distributed to the small satellite dome where the ozone radiometer is located. The power is not connected to the base UPS's, so the radar has its own small UPS. For more information on the radar hut, refer to [this](2_infrastructure.md#radar-hut).

There is 20 antenna masts forming part of the radar infrastructure on which the antennas are mounted. See [here](#infrastructure.md#masts) for more details on the maintenance and climbing of these masts.

### Climbing Gear
Climbing gear for antenna maintenance is kept in the radar hut as well. This gear should be inspected on a regular basis according to standards provided during the working at heights training in Cape Town.

It is the responsibility of the overwintering radar engineer to ensure that the climbing gear is always ready to go and well maintained. See \tabref{infra_gear} for a list of all equipment that needs to be available.

## Overview

There is a lifeline stretching from the base to the radar hut, as indicated on the map in [figure 1](#figure-1-map-of-sanae-iv-science-area).

The static infrastructure of the radar consists mainly of the radar hut and the 20 antenna masts with their stay ropes.

The radar hut contains emergency supplies, climbing gear, tools, various spare parts for the radar and has electricity relayed to it from the base.

Each antenna mast has eight stay ropes that keeps it upright. These ropes break from time to time and then needs to be repaired or replaced.
