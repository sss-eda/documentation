# Conclusion
That concludes the SuperDARN HF Radar's maintenance manual. 

Here are some recommended improvements to the system:
- Add any corrections or upgrades to this maintenance manual for the new antarctic radar engineer.
- Develop a protocol or software for logging, and keeping track of, the servicing and maintenance of transceiver boxes.
- Develop a script that will restart the entire radar in the correct order. Build on the `PDU_Control.sh` script.
