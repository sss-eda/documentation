## Front Panel
The front panel can be programmed using a Zilog programming device. It can be programmed directly from the Zilog IDE or using a .hex file and a generic programming software package.

The front panel code was update during 2017 and 2018. The newest version of the software, as well as the older versions, is available on the radar server. If the software is modified, a new version needs to be saved in the same folder. The most recent version should always be uploaded to the server as soon as possible to prevent any future installations that might be outdated.

When a new Lantronix module is installed in a transceiver box, the code needs to be updated to associate the box name with the MAC address provided on the Lantronix module.
