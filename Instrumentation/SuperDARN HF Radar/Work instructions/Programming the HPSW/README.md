# HPSW

It should only be necessary to program the CPLD on the HPSW once, right after it's been manufactured. This will most probably be done at SANSA Space Science in Hermanus. It can be programmed using JTAG and the code is available on the radar server as well.

This software is standard and doesn't require any modifications or upgrades.
